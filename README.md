## Decription
**WARNING**
This application will encrypt your data, run at your own risk! Do not close the application or else the encryption key will be *lost*.

RansomGame is an educational app to learn about windows app memory sniffing using ```window.h```.
RansomGame encrypts files using AES and waits for a specific process to be launched (the specific process is given below). Once the process is launched, it looks int its memory for a specific value.

## Decrypt Files
In order to decrypt the files, a score of 0.2 billion must be achieved in the lunatic difficulty.

## Build
The project requires an external library [crypto++](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) in order to build. Be sure to install the submodules with the git command.

## Game
The required game to unlock the files is [Touhou 6: Koumakyou - The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil ](https://moriyashrine.org/files/file/13-touhou-6-koumakyou-the-embodiment-of-scarlet-devil/).
